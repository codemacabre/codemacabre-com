---

I own a _lot_ of books and I don't read anywhere near as quickly as I used to. Here's my embarrassingly long list of books I own but haven't yet finished. I'm hoping that posting this publicly will serve as encouragement to actually finish reading them!

### Latest acquisitions
It was my birthday recently and I received the following:
