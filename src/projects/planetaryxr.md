PlanetaryXR is web app featuring 3D planetary bodies modelled accurately based on relative size and rotational speed, axial tilt and available satellite imagery.

Initally intended to explore the use of mobile devices with augmented reality (AR) markers, PlanetaryXR is an experiment with the idea of using mixed reality in the classroom.

This project was used by the Mars Society in Phase 1 (prototype and demo) of the [MarsVR](https://marsvr.com) project, and was later used to pitch a new workshop at Cardiff University’s [School of Geography and Planning](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/geography-planning), exploring the use of augmented reality to visualise maps and architectural plans.
