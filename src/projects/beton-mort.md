💭 **Status**: Planning {.callout}

Béton Mort is a series of data visualisations of homeless death in the UK.

The name is based on the French term, _béton brut_{lang=fr}, or _raw concrete_, an architectural concrete associated with brutalism. _Béton Mort_{lang=fr}, or roughly, _raw death_ suggests a brutalist depiction of death, stark and unflinching. 

The homelessness crisis has seen a marked increase, with homeless deaths climbing to 1313 in 2022 in the UK, according to the Museum of Homelessness' [Dying Homeless Project](https://museumofhomelessness.org/dhp). Béton Mort aims to visualise these figures across a variety of metrics in a series of graphics built using [D3](https://d3js.org).

This project is currently in very early development.
