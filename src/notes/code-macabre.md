The Code Macabre is a modern-day allegory, based on the medieval [_Danse Macabre_{lang=fr}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danse_Macabre). Imagine a series of skeletal figures marching towards shining computer monitors, televisions and mobile devices, the screens mirroring the figures' movements in decaying pixels.

The meaning of this allegory is that we are all marching towards our inexorable death, as in the _Danse Macabre_{lang=fr}, and are all equalised by our mortal commonality. However, with the advent of digital media, our online detritus will remain, extending our lives; while bits rot and pixels blink out of existence, our digital selves will much more slowly fade as the web shambles forever forwards.

We are not our digital selves, nor should we aspire to extend our lives in this way. But as with humanity's influence on the physical planet, we are leaving a smear of manufactured waste in our wake; plastics, silicon chips, data all trail behind us as we advance towards our inevitable demise. As our intelligence is devalued and reassigned to complex probability machines, so too do our physical entities deteriorate into hollow shells of our rich existences; our social networks prioritise quantity of interactions over quality and reduce us to more mere data points.

Our cybernetic selves are manipulated and exploited by behemothic digital corporations, yet we persist, and persist.

The Code Macabre is a mirror and a warning. We are death, pending.

As digital beings, as cyborgs, we are forever to be leeched of our privacy and individuality until our data merges with the colossal stream that is the web. Without concerted effort to resist, we will be washed away with the tide of digital ephemera.
