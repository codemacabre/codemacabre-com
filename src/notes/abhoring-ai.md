The term 'AI' fills me with disgust. It's an inaccurate way of referring to automated plagiarism and [bullshit machines](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chatgpt-isnt-hallucinating-its-bullshitting/).

> What characterizes the bullshitter [...] is that they just donâ€™t care whether what they say is true. ChatGPT and its peers cannot care, and they are instead, in a technical sense, bullshit machines.

I've avoided using it fairly successfully, although I have resorted to ChatGPT a couple of times when development documentation or old-fashioned web searching fails me, and it inevitably provided me with incorrect information; it has suggested code with incorrect syntax, and recommended I use language features which don't exist. The results from this so-called AI would have confused me, had I not already been skeptical of the usefulness of its answers.

The likes of Google and Microsoft are [trying to suggest that AI can work as a search engine](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592647/ai-search-bing-bard-chatgpt-microsoft-google-problems-challenges), but with its propensity to muddle information and spit out inaccurate responses, it's not worth using it without being able to verify anything it provides. This would add time and effort on top of its results which could be better put towards deeper, more thorough, web searches. 

On top of that, the multimedia generated by AI, such as images and video content, is detrimental to creators. Just like its textual counterpart, it pollutes the ecosystem with [increasingly difficult-to-identify disinformation](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080801/generative-ai-boosting-disinformation-and-propaganda-freedom-house/), risks executives [cutting costs](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-taking-jobs-fears-artists-say-already-happening-2023-10) by choosing AI slop over real art produced by human artists, and is a [tool for abuse](https://www.404media.co/1-in-10-minors-say-their-friends-use-ai-to-generate-nudes-of-other-kids-survey-finds/).

And as for the environmental impact of using AI, there have been multiple reports with statistics like generating 100 words with ChatGPT [consumes the equivalent of a bottle of water](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/18/energy-ai-use-electricity-water-data-centers/), and a ChatGPT-powered search [consumes almost 10 times the amount of electricity as a search on Google](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/06/21/artificial-intelligence-nuclear-fusion-climate/). Emissions are through the roof.

AI is a scourge, a waste, and a mess. I abhor it. I won't use it again and I suggest you don't, either.
