<h3 id="fun-facts">Fun facts</h3>
<p>Myles has a menagerie of multi- and no-legged pets, including:</p>
<ul class="indented">
  <li>giant African land snails</li>
  <li>various species of millipedes</li>
  <li>various species of tarantulas</li>
  <li>a pair of blue death-feigning beetles</li>
  <li>occasionally, stick insects</li>
</ul>
<p>…and one human child.</p>
<p>
  As morbid as it sounds, Myles loves graveyards, crypts and catacombs. Where possible, he tries to visit weird and
  unusual ones, or just take a quiet walk around a local one.
